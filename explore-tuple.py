# DO NOT EDIT
odds = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
evens = 2, 4, 6, 8

# Step 1: Print out the result of adding evens to odds
#print( odds + evens)


# Step 2: Print out the result of multiplying odds by three
#print( odds * 3)


# Step 3A: Use print to find out if odds is less than evens
#print(odds < evens)


# Step 3B: Print out your explanation of why 3A has that result
#goes by the first num in each tuple

# Step 4: Print out the average of the numbers in evens using one line of code
print(sum(evens) / len(evens))

# Step 5A: Write a function 'minmaxmean' that accepts an iterable and
#         returns the minimum value, the maximum value and the average (mean)


# Step 5B: Use print to confirm you function is working on evens and odds


# BONUS: Call your function with a new tuple of your own creation
#        And print the results in a pretty way
