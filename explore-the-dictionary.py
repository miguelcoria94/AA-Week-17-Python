# There are two ways to declare dictionaries
# Create a dictionary and assign it to the d1 variable using the dict()
# constructor that has key/value pairs
#   key: "module", value: "Python 3"
#   key: "subject", value: "Dictionaries"
d1 = dict(module="Python 3", subject="Dictionaries")


# Create a dictionary and assign it to the d2 variable using the dictionary
# literal that has key/value pairs
#   key: "module", value: "Python 3"
#   key: "subject", value: "Dictionaries"
d2 =  {'module': "Python 3", 'subject': "Dictionaries"}


# Unlike JavaScript, the keys in Python dictionaries can be any kind of
# value, not just strings or Symbols. Add a key to d1 that is the number
# one with the value "one". Then, add another key to d1 that is a string
# that contains the character 1 and give it the value of "one". Then,
# print the dictionary to see what's in there.


# Convert d1 to a list using the list() method. Then, print it. What gets
# put into the list?
d1_as_list =  # Your conversion here


# Now, check that the following keys are in d1
#  "module"    should be True
#  "subject"   should be True
#  "age"       should be False
#  1           should be True
#  "1"         should be True
#  "one"       should be False
#  True        should be False
