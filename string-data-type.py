# you can wrap strings with single and double quotes

# multiline strings - python allows strings to span multiple lines using what's called triple quotes

print('''My instructions are very long so to make them
more readable in the code I am putting them on
more than one line. I can even include "quotes"
of any kind because they won't get confused with
the end of the string!''')

# calculating length - check how long a string is using len()

print(len("Spaghetti"))
